What is a VPN?
SIMPLE: Virtual Private Network = secure
tunnel through Internet! Imagine sending mail in locked box instead of postcard.
VPN encrypts your data (locks box) so hackers can't read it. Makes public
Internet act like private company network.
Like having dedicated cable from home to office, but using Internet!


TECHNICAL:
VPN extends private network across public network (Internet). 
 Enables users to send/receive data as if directly connected to private network.
 Creates encrypted tunnel between endpoints.
Uses encapsulation and encryption to secure data traversing untrusted networks. 
Provides authentication, data integrity, confidentiality.


Firewalls — Network Security Gatekeepers

SIMPLE:
Network BOUNCER!
 Sits between networks, allows good traffic, blocks bad traffic. 
Like nightclub bouncer checking IDs — valid ID = enter, no ID = denied! Inspects every packet, decides allow or block based on rules.

TECHNICAL:
Network security device that monitors and controls incoming/outgoing traffic based on predetermined security rules.
 Establishes barrier between trusted internal network and untrusted external network (Internet). 
First line of defense.
