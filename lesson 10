Twisted Pair Specifications:
Cable Categories (MEMORIZE!):
• Cat5: 100 Mbps, 100 MHz, OBSOLETE (don't use!)
• Cat5e: 1 Gbps, 100 MHz, 100m - MINIMUM
today
• Cat6: 10 Gbps (55m), 1 Gbps (100m), 250 MHz - RECOMMENDED
• Cata: 10 Gbps (100m), 500 MHz, shielded - HIGH PERFORMANCE
• Cat7: 10+ Gbps, 600 MHz, fully shielded -
FUTURE/DATA CENTER
Maximum Distance: 100 meters (328 feet) for ALL categories
• Includes patch cables at both ends
• Beyond 100m: use switch or fiber
impact
ACADE-
MIES &
CAMPS
Wire Gauge: 22-24 AWG
(American Wire Gauge)
• Lower number = thicker wire = better but expensive
• 23 AWG common for Cat6
4 Pairs = 8 Wires:
• Pair 1: Blue/White-Blue
• Pair 2: Orange/White-Orange
• Pair 3: Green/White-Green
• Pair 4: Brown/White-Brown
Connector: RJ-45 (8P8C - 8
position, 8 contact)


UTP VS STP
UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair):
No Shielding,
Lighter,
cheaper, most
common. Good environment.
for normal office
STP (Shielded Twisted Pair): Metal foil/braid shield protects from EMI.
Heavier, expensive, grounded. Use near electrical interference (motors, generators,
fluorescent lights). Both
use same RJ-45 connectors.


Straight-Through vs Crossover Cables
Straight-Through: Same pin layout both ends (T568A or T568B both ends).
Use PC→Switch, Switch→Router, Router→PC. 99% of cables.
Crossover: Flipped transmit/receive pins. T568A one end, T568B other end.
OLD USE: PC→PC, Switch→Switch.
TODAY: Auto-MDI-X eliminates need! Modern devices auto-detect and adjust.
Still
useful for troubleshooting.
