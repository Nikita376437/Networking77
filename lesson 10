Twisted Pair Specifications:
Cable Categories (MEMORIZE!):
• Cat5: 100 Mbps, 100 MHz, OBSOLETE (don't use!)
• Cat5e: 1 Gbps, 100 MHz, 100m - MINIMUM
today
• Cat6: 10 Gbps (55m), 1 Gbps (100m), 250 MHz - RECOMMENDED
• Cata: 10 Gbps (100m), 500 MHz, shielded - HIGH PERFORMANCE
• Cat7: 10+ Gbps, 600 MHz, fully shielded -
FUTURE/DATA CENTER
Maximum Distance: 100 meters (328 feet) for ALL categories
• Includes patch cables at both ends
• Beyond 100m: use switch or fiber
impact
ACADE-
MIES &
CAMPS
Wire Gauge: 22-24 AWG
(American Wire Gauge)
• Lower number = thicker wire = better but expensive
• 23 AWG common for Cat6
4 Pairs = 8 Wires:
• Pair 1: Blue/White-Blue
• Pair 2: Orange/White-Orange
• Pair 3: Green/White-Green
• Pair 4: Brown/White-Brown
Connector: RJ-45 (8P8C - 8
position, 8 contact)


UTP VS STP
UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair):
No Shielding,
Lighter,
cheaper, most
common. Good environment.
for normal office
STP (Shielded Twisted Pair): Metal foil/braid shield protects from EMI.
Heavier, expensive, grounded. Use near electrical interference (motors, generators,
fluorescent lights). Both
use same RJ-45 connectors.


Straight-Through vs Crossover Cables
Straight-Through: Same pin layout both ends (T568A or T568B both ends).
Use PC→Switch, Switch→Router, Router→PC. 99% of cables.
Crossover: Flipped transmit/receive pins. T568A one end, T568B other end.
OLD USE: PC→PC, Switch→Switch.
TODAY: Auto-MDI-X eliminates need! Modern devices auto-detect and adjust.
Still
useful for troubleshooting.


EMI and Crosstalk
EMI (Electromagnetic Interference):
External interference from power lines, motors, fluorescent lights, microwaves. Causes signal distortion.
Solution: Shielded cable or route away from sources. Crosstalk: Signal from one wire pair bleeds into adjacent pair.
NEAR-END (NEXT): Interference at transmit end.
FAR-END (FEXT): Interference at receive end.
Solution: Better cable category (more twists), proper termination.


Fiber Optic Overview
Glass or plastic fiber transmits data as LIGHT pulses instead of electrical signals.
Core: carries light.
Cladding: reflects light back into core (total internal reflection).
Buffer: protects fiber.
ADVANTAGES: Immune to EMI, long distances (km), high bandwidth (100+ Gbps),
secure (hard to tap),
lightweight.
DISADVANTAGES: Expensive, fragile, requires specialized equipment, difficult to terminate.


Wireless Media Basics
Radio frequency (RF) waves carry data through air. No physical cable!
ADVANTAGES: Mobility, easy deployment, reaches difficult areas.
DISADVANTAGES: Interference, security issues, slower than wired, distance limited, obstacles block signal. Standards: 802.11 (WiFi).
Frequencies: 2.4 GHz (longer range, more interference), 5 GHz (faster, shorter range), 6 GHz (newest, fastest).
Use: Mobile devices, temporary setups, supplements wired. Detailed wireless in Lesson 14!


Desktop to switch (100m): Cat6 UTP.
Data center rack-to-rack (10m): Multi-mode fiber OM4 LC.
Building-to-building (500m): Single-mode fiber LC.
Industrial (motors nearby): Cata STP.
Home office: Cat6 UTP.
ISP connection: Single-mode fiber or coax.
Remember: Cat good default choice! Future-proof without breaking budget.


DHCP - Dynamic IP Assignment
DHCP: Ports 67 (server), 68 (client), UDP. Automatically assigns IP addresses to clients.
DORA process: Discover (client broadcasts 'need IP'), Offer (server offers IP), Request (client requests offered IP), Acknowledge (server confirms) .
Lease time: How long client can use IP.
Scope: Range of IPs server can assign. Reservations: Specific IP for specific MAC address.
Without DHCP: manual IP configuration on every device!
